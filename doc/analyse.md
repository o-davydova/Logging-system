# LOGGING SYSTEM
> The C++ logging system project aims to efficiently transmit messages from various user applications to a central logging server. 
Consisting of a client library and a logging server, this system simplifies the logging process by collecting, processing, and outputting logs to standard output. 
This project offers a solution that enhances monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities. 
This analysis compares similar projects to highlight the significance and innovation of the proposed logging system.


### Log4j (Apache Log4j)
| Advantages ✓ | Disadvantages ✘ |
| --- | -------------------- |
| Highly customizable logging framework for Java applications | Requires a learning curve for configuration and setup, which may be challenging for beginners |
| Supports multiple output destinations such as files, databases, and remote servers | Documentation can be extensive and overwhelming for new users |
| Provides various logging levels for filtering and controlling log messages | May require additional libraries or dependencies for certain functionalities |


### Serilog
| Advantages ✓ | Disadvantages ✘ |
| --- | -------------------- |
| Flexible and easy-to-use logging library for .NET applications | Limited community support compared to more established logging frameworks |
| Supports structured logging, allowing developers to attach key-value pairs to log events | May lack certain advanced features present in other logging frameworks |
| Integrates seamlessly with various sinks for storing log data, including files, databases, and cloud-based services | Configuration options may not be as extensive as some other solutions |


### Syslog-ng
| Advantages ✓ | Disadvantages ✘ |
| --- | -------------------- |
| Feature-rich and scalable log management solution for Unix-like systems | Configuration can be complex, requiring knowledge of system administration and networking concepts |
| Supports a wide range of log sources and destinations, including files, databases, and network protocols | Limited official documentation, which may require users to rely on community resources for assistance |
| Provides advanced filtering and processing capabilities for managing large volumes of log data efficiently | May be overkill for small-scale deployments or applications with simple logging requirements |


### ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
| Advantages ✓ | Disadvantages ✘ |
| --- | -------------------- |
| Comprehensive log management platform offering log ingestion, storage, analysis, and visualization capabilities | Complexity in setting up and configuring the entire stack, especially for users with limited DevOps experience |
| Highly scalable and suitable for handling large volumes of log data in distributed environments | Resource-intensive, requiring significant hardware resources for optimal performance in production environments |
| Provides powerful search and visualization features through Kibana, enabling users to gain insights from log data easily | May incur costs associated with infrastructure and maintenance, particularly for enterprise deployments |


# Logging System Features

> In this project, we aim to develop a logging system that is easy to use, especially for users with limited experience in this field. 
Our goal is to create a convenient and effective tool to help you track events and errors in your software product.


#### Below is a list of key features that we plan to include in the logging system, tailored to your level and project needs.
- **_Easy Setup:_** Provide a straightforward setup process where users can configure logging with minimal effort, similar to setting up an email account.
- **_Basic Logging Options:_** Offer simple options for logging to a file or displaying logs in the console, akin to printing messages to a text file or displaying them on the screen.
- **_Error Handling:_** Implement basic error handling to ensure the logging system continues to run smoothly even if errors occur, similar to displaying a message if the logging fails.
- **_Log Levels:_** Include basic log levels like "debug," "info," "warning," and "error," allowing users to categorize log messages based on their severity.
- **_Log Rotation:_** Integrate a simple log rotation feature to prevent log files from growing too large, automatically creating new log files when the current one reaches a certain size.
- **_Documentation:_** Provide straightforward documentation with step-by-step instructions on how to set up and use the logging system, avoiding technical jargon and using clear language.
